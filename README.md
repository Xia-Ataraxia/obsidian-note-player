# Note Player

Play YouTube audio from playlists that are plain Obsidian notes. Each track is a Markdown note, each playlist is a note listing tracks, and a turntable-style player plays them without leaving your vault.

## Features

- Playlists and tracks are notes with frontmatter, so they work with links, properties, and Bases.
- Add a track from a YouTube URL; the note is created with the title, channel, and thumbnail.
- Audio is downloaded once with yt-dlp and cached locally for instant playback.
- Play local audio files from your vault.
- Turntable now-playing card with optional needle and crackle sounds.
- Queue, repeat-one, autoplay, and a persistent selection between sessions.
- Companion `Music.base` and `Playlists.base` views.

## Requirements

Desktop only (Obsidian 1.13.0 or later). Downloading audio needs two command-line tools on your `PATH`:

- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), for downloading and for expanding playlist links
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org), which yt-dlp uses to convert audio to MP3 or WAV

```bash
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg   # macOS; use your package manager elsewhere
```

## Installation

From the Community plugins browser, search for **Note Player**, then install and enable it.

Manual: download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Xia-Ataraxia/obsidian-note-player/releases/latest), copy them into `<vault>/<config folder>/plugins/note-player/`, then enable the plugin.

## Usage

### Add a track by YouTube URL

Copy a YouTube link, then do any one of these:

- Run the command **Add YouTube URL to playlist** and paste it into the modal. The paste adds the track immediately.
- Click the link button in the player toolbar.
- Paste straight into the player view.

The track note is created in the **Music folder** setting (or Obsidian's default location for new notes) and appended to the selected playlist. If no playlist exists, one named `Inbox` is created. A video that is already in the library reuses its note. A YouTube playlist link adds every video in it, using yt-dlp.

### Playlist notes

A playlist is a note with `type: playlist` and a `tracks` property listing links to track notes. A track note has `type: music` and a YouTube URL in the `youtube` or `url` property. Property names and note types are configurable in settings.

### Player

Open it from the ribbon icon or the **Open player view** command. Other commands:

- **Refresh music library**
- **Load active playlist note into player**
- **Add active note to selected playlist**
- **Create or refresh companion bases files**

### Turntable

The now-playing card shows a spinning record with a tonearm. Starting playback lowers the needle with a synthesized drop and vinyl crackle; pausing lifts it with a soft tick. The sounds are generated with Web Audio (no audio files are bundled) and follow the player volume. Turn them off with **Turntable sounds** in settings. With reduced motion enabled the record stays still.

## Settings

Playlist folder, music folder, property mapping for URL, thumbnail, and artist, playlist schema (track list, description, cover, note types), audio format (MP3 or WAV), autoplay, open on startup, and **Turntable sounds**.

## Disclosures

Note Player is desktop only. It has no telemetry and no accounts, and it sends nothing to any server except YouTube.

### Network

- Adding a track sends its video URL to `youtube.com/oembed`, through Obsidian's `requestUrl`, to read the title, channel and thumbnail. No API key is used.
- Thumbnails load from `img.youtube.com`.
- Downloads, playlist expansion and streaming run yt-dlp, which contacts YouTube. A track that isn't cached yet streams straight from YouTube's media servers while it downloads.
- While a track plays, the stream link for the next uncached track in the queue is looked up ahead of time. Apart from that and thumbnails, YouTube is only contacted when you add a track or play one that isn't cached. Local vault audio never uses the network.

### Running programs (yt-dlp and ffmpeg)

- The plugin runs `yt-dlp` as a child process to download audio, resolve stream links and expand playlist links. yt-dlp calls `ffmpeg` to convert audio. No other programs are run.
- It finds yt-dlp on your `PATH` or in the usual install folders (it tries to start each one and keeps the first that runs) (`~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`).
- To turn this off, don't install yt-dlp (or uninstall it). Local audio files in your vault still play.

### Files

- Downloaded audio and waveform data (`<id>.peaks.json`) are stored in `<vault>/<config folder>/plugins/note-player/audio-cache`. The plugin reads, lists and deletes them through Obsidian's vault adapter. Only yt-dlp itself writes into this folder, using the absolute path of the vault.
- Nothing outside your vault is written. To clear the cache, delete the folder.

### Reading your vault

- To build the music library, the plugin reads the frontmatter of Markdown notes in your **Music folder** (or Obsidian's default location for new notes) and its subfolders, through Obsidian's metadata cache. It does this on startup, when notes change, and when you run **Refresh music library**. Note contents aren't read, and nothing leaves your device.
- The property fields in settings suggest frontmatter keys found in that same folder.

### Clipboard

- The plugin never reads the clipboard. When you paste a YouTube link into the **Add YouTube URL to playlist** field with your own paste (Cmd/Ctrl+V), it is added at once.
- Pasting a YouTube link into the player view adds that track. Other pasted text is ignored.

## Troubleshooting

- **yt-dlp not found:** confirm `yt-dlp --version` works in a terminal and that its folder is on your `PATH`.
- **Audio not playing:** confirm ffmpeg is installed and the video is publicly accessible, then run **Refresh music library**.
- **Playlist missing:** check that the note's `type` matches the playlist note type in settings.
